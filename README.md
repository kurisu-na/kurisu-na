# 👋 Hello~!
- 👩‍💻 I’m Christina! In case you didn't know, "Kurisu" is the katakana spelling of "Chris."
- 👀 I have a lot of interests, including languages. I have a day job as a junior data scientist, but sometimes I still freelance as an English-Indonesian translator.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about how to do my job properly! Haha. It involves processing Indonesian census data, especially about heritage languages.
- 💞️ I'm a nerd! I love science, tech, sci-fi, fantasy, video games, anime... a lot of things, really.
- 📫 You can reach me by visiting my translation portfolio website: https://kurisunatasha-at.work/
